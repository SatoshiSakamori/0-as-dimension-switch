# − as a Dimensional Switch

This project explores a conceptual model in which the **minus sign (−)** is reinterpreted not as a mere directional indicator or negation, but as a **dimensional switch** — a symbolic operator that shifts a number from one axis (dimension) to another.

## 💡 Core Idea

In traditional mathematics, the number line is a one-dimensional structure:  
- Positive and negative numbers lie on the same axis, extending in opposite directions from zero.

However, in this model:
- **The minus sign (−) changes the dimension** on which a number exists.
- Positive numbers are placed on the **x-axis**, while negative numbers are placed on the **y-axis**.
- The number `0` is located at the **intersection point** of these axes — it is not a midpoint, but a **dimensional switch** or pivot.

Thus:
- `+1` → (1, 0) on the x-axis  
- `−1` → (0, 1) on the y-axis  
- `0`   → (0, 0), the dimensional origin

In this interpretation, **`−1` is not the inverse of `+1` on the same line**, but rather `+1` existing in a different dimension.

## 🧭 Conceptual Significance

This idea is **philosophical and visual**, not mathematically rigorous.  
It aims to:
- Challenge conventional thinking about signs, numbers, and dimensions
- Provide new ways to visualize abstract mathematical concepts
- Serve as an **educational or imaginative framework**, especially for learners grappling with the idea of negative numbers

## 📚 Project Goals

- ✨ Create intuitive diagrams and visualizations  
- 🎞️ Develop animations using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/)  
- 🧠 Document thought experiments and conceptual variations  
- 🌱 Inspire alternative ways of thinking about number systems

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `README.md`: This file
- `diagrams/`: Conceptual illustrations (planned)
- `animations/`: Manim scripts (planned)
- `notes/`: Ongoing philosophical and mathematical notes

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is **not a formal mathematical system**.  
It is an **exploratory framework** for intuition, visualization, and creativity — not for formal computation or proof.

## 🌀 Example: Dimensional Mapping of Numbers

```
  y-axis
    |
 −2 •       (0, 2)
 −1 •       (0, 1)
    •———•———•———•———→ x-axis
          0   1   2
         (0,0)(1,0)(2,0)
```

In this diagram:
- Positive numbers lie on the horizontal x-axis.
- Negative numbers lie on the vertical y-axis.
- The minus sign (−) moves a number off the original axis into an orthogonal dimension.
