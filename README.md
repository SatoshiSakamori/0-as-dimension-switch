# ðŸ§  0-as-dimension-switch

## Overview

In the standard number line, 0 sits at the center, with positive numbers to the right and negative numbers to the left. However, **0 has fundamentally different properties** compared to other numbers â€” such as being undefined when dividing by it, or acting as the source of singularities in various mathematical contexts.

This project explores an alternative idea: **treating 0 not as a regular number but as a "dimension switch" point**. Inspired by concepts like **absolute zero temperature**, where quantities only exist in one direction (positive), this concept proposes a number system where **divergences and singularities can be avoided by reinterpreting 0 as a boundary between dimensions**.

## Background

- In real-number space, 0 functions as a central point of symmetry. But this symmetry may be the very reason why undefined behavior (like division by 0) or divergence occurs.
- In physical quantities such as temperature, absolute zero acts as a **one-way boundary**; there's no negative temperature in the classical sense. This inspired the idea that **0 might represent a structural shift**, not a symmetrical center.
- For instance, a function like `1/x`, which diverges at `x â†’ 0`, might behave differently if 0 is **not part of the same dimension**, and **continuity across 0 is not required**.

## Core Idea

- **0 is not an exception to arithmetic â€” it is a transition point between dimensions.**
- **The number line splits at 0, and different mathematical rules or interpretations may apply on either side.**
- **Operations involving 0 (like division by 0) are redefined as dimensional transformations rather than conventional arithmetic.**

## Goals

- Propose a structure where **0 acts as a hub between different mathematical systems**
- Avoid divergence and singularities by **redefining continuity and space around 0**
- Explore connections with geometric or physical concepts (like projective space, Riemann surfaces, or physical constants)

## Future Work

- Visual representation using **Manim** or other animation tools
- Simulation with **Python**
- Mathematical formalization in **LaTeX**
- Explore connections to **hyperbolic geometry**, **projective space**, or **non-commutative algebra**

## Notes

I'm not a native English speaker and my mathematical background is still evolving. This concept is experimental, and I'm exploring it step by step. I used **ChatGPT** to help write this README and clarify the structure of my idea. I'm open to feedback, suggestions, or collaboration.
